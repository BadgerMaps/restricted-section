---

**Static sites are awesome**. Fast, secure, versioned in git. Great way to present information that doesn't need to be dynamic â€” documentation, assets, event agendas.

But sometimes you want to have a static site inaccessible publicly. Something that can be **accessed only if the user is part of your G Suite domain**.

That's the Restricted Section. A very simple Node app that you can **host on Heroku with a click**, and start publishing content that is only accessible with the right email domain.
